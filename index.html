        <h1>Syracuse Has Found Some Much Needed Juice On The Recruting Trail</h1>

        <p class="dek"> With Head Coach Fran Brown at the reigns, Syracuse has seen a major uptick on the recruting trail.  </p>

        <p>In just a few months, Fran Brown went from being a coordinator at Georgia few people in Syracuse had heard of to the No. 1 recruiter in the nation as SU’s new head foodball coach.  

</p>

        <p>Brown brought in the highest-rated recruiting class since 1995 with an average rating of 87.42 out of 100. The class includes the 6th, 7th, and 8th best recruits of all time for Syracuse.

<p>Mike McAllister has been covering Syracuse recruiting for many years. For the first time in a while, he had a hard time choosing his favorite player from the class of 2024.<p>
        <p>"Honestly, it was a little easier to do that, you know, because they usually kind of had one or two guys kind of stood out among the rest,” McAllister said. “Whereas I feel like Fran has done a really good job of building depth in this class.”

        <p>McAllister chose Defensive back Ibn McDaniels out of Elizabeth HS in New Jersey. Fran Brown and Co. wanted McDaniels mainly because of his staggering measurements. He is six feet and three inches tall, which is beneficial as a defensive back.</p>

        <p>“If they're able to get him to play corner or if he's a good enough athlete to play corner,” McAllister said. With his size, length, and speed, I think he's got the potential to be a special player.”</p>

        <p>Fran Brown will have to continue to find more underrated prospects in the Northeast, as there is not as much high-level talent in the region. This lack of talent is the stark opposite of Fran Brown’s last school. In the state of Georgia alone, there have been 114 five-stars since 1980, according to composite rankings from 247 sports. If all of the border states were included, there have been almost 500 5-star recruits.</p>

<p>In New England, there have only been 6 five star recruits since 1980. In New York alone, only 10 five stars. According to the data, the only two high talent-producing states in the northeast are New Jersey and Pennsylvania having housed 47 and 55 five-stars, respectively.<p> 
        <p>But it is not all doom and gloom for the Northeast schools. Though there are not as many high-level prospects, this does not mean the Northeast does not produce NFL players. According to data from Football Reference, New York has had just as many players reach the NFL as some states in the South. 
</p>

<p><iframe title="All-Time Pro Players From Each State " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-TxFfS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TxFfS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="510" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script><p>

        <p>The data shows that New York has put 903 players into the NFL, which is second best in the Northeast. The leader of the northeastern states is Pennsylvania, which has 1,511 players in the NFL. These statistics show that NFL talent. </p>

        <p>McAllister agrees that there is some talent in the Northeast. However, the issue really lies in the quantity of this NFL talent.</p>

        <p>“In Central New York, Upstate New York, while there is Division One talent, there's not enough that you can build an entire recruiting class around local talent,” McAllister Said, “whereas at almost every other school at the Power five-level, there is.”<p>

            <p>This issue is further compounded when Syracuse also has to fight against other schools in the northeast for this limited amount of talent. Other schools, including Penn State, Rutgers, Boston College, Pittsburgh, and Maryland, must battle for the limited talent.<p>

                <p><iframe title="Average Recruiting Ratings Between Northeast Schools 1980-2024  " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3OSc2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3OSc2/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="446" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script><p>

    <p>The graph shows that Fran Brown has helped Syracuse leapfrog most of its competitors in just one year. But one team continues to sit atop the Northeastern throne. Penn State has had the highest-rated recruiting classes in the Northeast since 2013.<p>

        <p>With the trajectory Coach Brown and the Syracuse football team are on, he might be able to steal the crown off the Nittany Lion’s head. McAllister believes that Coach Brown wants to go a step further. 
<p>

    <p>“You know, and I don't think he just wants to become Penn State; I think he wants to take it to a level above what Penn State has been.”<p>
